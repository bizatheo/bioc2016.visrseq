title: "Making your packages accessible to non-programmer collaborators using the VisRseq platform"
author: "Hamid Younesy"
date: "June 26, 2016 | BioC 2016"
abstract: > 
  I will introduce the VisRseq platform and walk the participants through the quick process of creating modules called R-apps from R packages. I expect this to be specially useful for bioinformaticians and package developers that develop R-based analysis tools and would like to make them accessible to their non-programmer collaborators or to the public without having to spend significant time on creating extensive graphical user interfaces. I will walk the participants through several examples of creating diverse types of apps, from simple plotting (e.g. plots) to intermediate (e.g. clustering) to more advanced (e.g. edgeR and DEseq) packages. I will also show how several R-apps can be linked together to create more complex workflows. Participants will require having beginner/intermediate knowledge of R and a machine with R and Java installation.
