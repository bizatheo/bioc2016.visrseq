# BioC2016 VisRseq
R package for the Bioc 2016 workshop: "Making your packages accessible to non-programmer collaborators using the VisRseq"

## Abstract
The goal of this workshop is to introduce the VisRseq platform and walk the participants through the quick process of creating modules called R-apps from their R packages. I expect this to be mostly useful for bioinformaticians and package developers that develop R-based analysis tools and would like to make them accessible to their non-programmer collaborators or to the public without having to spend time on creating extensive graphical user interfaces. I will walk the participants through several examples of creating diverse types of apps, from simple plotting (e.g. ggplot) to intermediate (e.g. clustering) to more advanced (e.g. edgeR and DEseq) packages. I will also show how several R-apps can be linked together to create more complex workflows. Participants will require having beginner/intermediate knowledge of R and a machine with R and Java installation.
